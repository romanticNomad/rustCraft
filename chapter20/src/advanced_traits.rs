// Associated types might seem like a similar concept to generics,
// in that the latter allow us to define a function without specifying what types it can handle.

// 1. Traits with assosiated types.
// 2. Operator Overloading.
// 3. Distinguishing identical methods.
// 4. Supertraits.
// 5. Newtype patter -> leveraging Deref and tuple struct.
